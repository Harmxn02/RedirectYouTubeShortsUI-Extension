# 🚫 'Redirect YouTube Shorts UI' Extension

Redirects YouTube Shorts to the regular player.

## 😥 Why?

Because the UI doesn't load 90% of the time.

You cannot:

- Like the video
- Dislike the video
- Read the comments to discuss what you thought of the video
- Share the video
- Scroll forwards in the video
- Scroll backwards in the video

... whenever this happens, and it happens too gosh-darn much

I don't know if it's got to do with adblock or something, but it's annoying as heck ... so, fix your poophead UI, YouTube!

## ⚡ Features

- 🔗 Auto-redirect Shorts to regular player
- 🔄 Works on all navigation (direct click, middle click to open in new tab)
- 🟢 Toggle on/off in popup

## 🛠️ Install

2. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` in your browser (the search bar)

Feel free to open issues or PRs if you want to add features or fix bugs! It's the first time I've made a browser extension, so I might have made some mistakes or missed some edge cases.
