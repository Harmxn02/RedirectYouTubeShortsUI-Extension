# 🚫 'Redirect YouTube Shorts UI' Extension

Redirects YouTube Shorts to the regular player.

## 😥 Why?

Because the UI doesn't load 90% of the time.

You cannot:

- Like the video
- Dislike the video
- Read the comments to discuss what you thought of the video
- Share the video
- Scroll forwards in the video
- Scroll backwards in the video

... whenever this happens, and it happens too gosh-darn much

I don't know if it's got to do with adblock or something, but it's annoying as heck ... so, fix your poophead UI, YouTube!
